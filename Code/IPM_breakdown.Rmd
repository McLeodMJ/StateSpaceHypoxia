# create mesh: sizes that we are running the IPM over
```{r}
# Lingcod 
# Fishing rate is referred to as exploitation rate
setwd("~/Box Sync/McLeod_thesis/Code")
source("./Library/params.R")
pars <- params("Lingcod")

# IPM integration parameters:
meshsize = 100
meshmin = 0
meshmax = pars$Linf * 2

x <- seq(from = meshmin, to = meshmax, length.out = meshsize) # different size classes
dx = diff(x)[1] #width of the 'rectangle' to do the midpoint rule *cough cough* left rule

```

# Survival part of Kernel 
```{r}
### create a mesh grid of size changes
 Size_c = t(matrix(x, nrow=length(x), ncol=length(x))) #- matrix of sizes at t  ## sizes same per column
   
#### Survival part of kernel
 # m= pars$m
 m=0  #check with mort. =0 - # should be dist. around Linf
### convert to probability
 timestep = 1
 pm <- exp(-m * timestep) # prob. survival
  # increases with size
 pm[pm<0] = 0 # make sure no negatives 
 
 
 #' 1. timestep? how do we decide this?
```

# Growth part of the kernel 
```{r}
### create a mesh grid of size changes
  Size_r = t(Size_c) #- matrix of sizes at t+1 ## sizes same per row

### Growth part of kernel. Do it this way so that we simulate many different growth trajectories in the population, averaged together.
  nLinfs = 1000 # how many different values of Linf to simulate
  
### create Matrices of simulated sizes
  Linfs <- rnorm(n = nLinfs, mean = pars$Linf, sd = pars$Linf.sd) # vector of random dist. of Linfs- max lengths
  Linf_sims <- matrix(Linfs, nrow = nLinfs, ncol = length(x)) # expand into a matrix so there is a corresponding value of Linf for each possible value in the length vector x
  # ^ same values for each column to run against different size distr.
  Size_chge <- t(matrix(x, ncol = nLinfs, nrow = length(x))) # expand x into a matrix so there is a value for each value of Linfs.mat ## size changes per column and goes up to mesh max size 

### Create range of growth rates
  VBlengths <-  Linf_sims - (Linf_sims - Size_chge) * exp(-pars$k * timestep) # VonBert -- use those two matrices to get the range of possible growth rates, as a function of X
  
  VBmean <- colMeans(VBlengths) # Take the mean across all of the different trajectories for each value of x
  VBsd <- VBmean * (pars$Linf.sd) # we want SD here
  
  Leng_mean <- t(matrix(VBmean, nrow = length(x), ncol = length(x))) # expand into a matrix with a corresponding value for each value of Y (the size at time t+1)
 
### convert to probability 
  pg <- dnorm(Size_r, mean = Leng_mean, sd = VBsd) # use dnorm to get the distribution of growth rates 
  # OUTPUTS 1000 X 100 MATRIX DUE TO SD VALUE WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE 100 X 100 MATRIX TO GO INTO FOR LOOP
  pg[pg<0] = 0 # make sure no negatives

### Run the kernel as prob. death * growth
  K = pm * pg 
  plot(K, type='l') # when mortality is 0 we want to see continuous growth 
```


# recruitment part of kernel 
## I think this is where we loose the resilence of the IPM
```{r}
### If adding fecundity too:
  Rvec = dnorm(x, pars$rec, pars$rec.sd) # size distribution of recruits
  Fec = pars$fec.const * Size_c ^(pars$fec.exp)  #leads to much smaller values than sample IPM 
  Fe = Fec * Rvec # combine the two
  # Fe values are very small although in the right spot, problem????
  plot(colSums(Fe), type= 'l') # does get bigger with size but very slight 
```
 

# run kernel 
```{r}
#K = K + Q; # add in fecundity to the growth/survival part
```

# run the model 
```{r}
### Initialize the model:
  time = 1000
  N = matrix(0, nrow = meshsize, ncol = time) #pop size w/ growth/mortal kernel
  E = matrix(0, nrow = meshsize, ncol = time) #pop size w/ ^^ & fecundity
  Ntest = matrix(0, nrow = meshsize, ncol = time) #pop size w/ ^^ & recruits added
  
  N[,1] <- Rvec  #* pars$Rmu  initialize with one pulse of new recruits

### Run the model
  for (t in 2:time){
    N[,t] <- K %*% N[,t-1] * dx  #+  Rvec  * pars$Rmu # midpoint rule integration
    E[,t] <- Fe %*% N[,t-1] * dx
  
  ###BH step
    #' BH eqn: (Methot and Tylor 2011 - eqn A.7)
    #' Ry = 4h*R0*Eggs / S0(1-h) + Eggs(5h -1)
  Eggs = sum(E[,t])*dx
  Recruits <- (4 * pars$steep * pars$rec * Eggs) / ((pars$s0 * (1 - pars$steep)) + (Eggs * (5 * pars$steep - 1)))
  
  Ntest[,t] = N[,t] + Recruits * Rvec 
  }
  
### total population size:
  sum(Ntest[ ,time] * dx)

plot(x, Ntest[ ,time], type = 'l')
plot(colSums(Ntest) * dx, type='l')
```
